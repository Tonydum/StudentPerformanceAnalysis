# Student Performance Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of student performances to uncover insights into various factors affecting academic outcomes. The dataset includes scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic and background information such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation course status.

## Objectives

To identify key factors that significantly impact student performance in academic subjects.
To provide actionable recommendations for educational stakeholders to improve student outcomes.
To utilize statistical methods for a robust analysis of student performance data.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, comprising diverse information on student demographics, background, and academic scores.

## Methodology

Data Cleaning: Standardizing column names, handling missing values, and addressing outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employing visualizations and summary statistics to understand data distribution and initial trends.

Statistical Analysis: Conducting t-tests and ANOVA to test hypotheses about the impact of different factors on student scores.

Outlier Analysis: Identifying and investigating outliers to understand their impact on the overall analysis.

## Key Findings

Test Preparation Course: Students who completed a test preparation course performed significantly better across all subjects.

Parental Education Level: A higher level of parental education correlates with better student performance.

Lunch Type: The type of lunch (standard vs. free/reduced) serves as an indicator of socio-economic status, significantly affecting student scores.

Gender Differences: Notable differences in subject-wise performance were observed between male and female students.

## Recommendations

- Enhancing accessibility to test preparation courses.
- Encouraging parental involvement in education, especially among parents with lower education levels.
- Addressing socio-economic disparities through targeted educational support.
  
## Tools Used

Python for data analysis (libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy).
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive code execution and visualization.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
- Run the Jupyter Notebooks to see the analysis in action.
